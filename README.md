## VML Tech Test Instructions

## VML Tech Test Instructions
For this coding challenge we want you to implement a simple HTML web page using React featuring: a playable video; some comments for that video, and; a button which can pause/play the video. You are free to style the page however you wish.
The acceptance criteria are:
- The video "Introducing Officely!" (id: 1) is displayed on the page.
- The title and author of the video are also displayed.
- The default browser controls for the video should not be displayed.
- The comments for that video are displayed on the page.
  - You should be able to sort the comments in ascending and descending date order.
- The comments section is displayed to the right of the video.
  - On screen <760px, the comments should display below the video.
- There is a button on the page labelled "Pause/Play" which toggles the video to play when clicked.
  - A button component has been provided for you.
  - It starts disabled but should be enabled when the video loads

You can request the video data from this endpoint:\
[https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jordansb/video-api/videos/1](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jordansb/video-api/videos/1)

And you can request an array of all comments for all videos from this endpoint:\
[https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jordansb/video-api/comments](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/jordansb/video-api/comments)

A button component will be provided for you in the project repository.
